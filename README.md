Hey there! I’m @BoserCoder 👋, and I’m here to share a little bit about myself.

It all started when I was just a kid with a love for problem-solving and creativity 💡. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by coding—especially HTML 💻. It’s amazing how you can bring a blank page to life with just a few lines of code. I’ve been learning through Visual Studio Code and absolutely loving every minute of it! 🖥️ My coding journey has been full of discovery, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.

When I’m not busy with code, you’ll probably find me on the soccer field ⚽. Soccer is another big passion of mine. I love the thrill of the game and the teamwork it requires 🙌. It’s something that keeps me active and sharp, balancing both the mind and body 🧠💪.

At just 10 years old 🎂, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. I even use GitHub Copilot in VS Code to help me learn and grow faster! 🤖 It’s like having a little coding buddy, always there to offer suggestions and help me explore new ideas.

I’m excited about the future 🌟, and I’m always on the lookout for ways to improve my coding skills 📈. Whether I’m building a website or learning new programming languages, I’m ready to take on whatever challenges come my way!

If you ever want to connect or chat about coding (or soccer!), you can reach me at kamatsohum45@gmail.com 📧. I’d love to hear from you!

Oh, and by the way—my pronouns are he/him 🙋‍♂️.

Thanks for stopping by and getting to know a little about me! See you around! 👋
